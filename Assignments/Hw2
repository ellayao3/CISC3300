<!-- Written Hw 2 Qs and As:
1. Define structural vs semantic meaning in regard to HTML elements.
    - Structural markup would be the elements that you can use to describe both headings and paragraphs.
    Semantic markup provides the extra information, for example, where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something you have written is a quotation, 
    the meanings of acronyms, etc. Example: <h1>, <h2>, and <p> would be structural & <cite> and <em> would be semantic. 

2. Why is it important to use correct html elements when designing web pages?
    - A semantically correct use of html elements is essential as it informs the browser and developer about its content. 
    In class we discussed the use of <strong> instead of <b>. Where the website will display both in bold. However, it is important to properly define the html 
    element since there may be a blind person that may be using a reading software. Properly defining the html elements allows for the users to get the 
    appropriate reading when they are listening to the content on the webpage. 

3. What are forms in html? What is their purpose? When would you use one?
    - Forms in html borrow the traditional term of ‘form’ in a physical written document. The concept in html refers to different elements that allow you to 
    collect information from visitors to your site (this lives inside the <form> element. Examples of uses could include: collecting users' contact information or usernames. 

4. Define and contrast inline vs block elements. 
    - Inline elements will always appear to continue on the same line as their neighboring elements. Examples: <a>, <b>, <em>, and <img> Block elements will 
    always appear to start on a new line in the browser window. Examples: <h>, <p>, <ul>, and <li> An inline doesn’t start on a new line and it only takes up 
    as much space as necessary. A block element always starts on a new line, and the browser automatically adds some space (a margin) before and after the element. 
    It takes up the full width of the available space. -->
