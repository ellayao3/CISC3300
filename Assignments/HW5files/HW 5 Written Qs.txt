What is the DOM? What is meant by the DOM tree?
Document Object Model (DOM) is the data representation of the objects that comprise the structure and content of a document on the web. It represents the webpage as nodes and objects; allowing programming languages to interact with the page. As an object-oriented representation of the web page, it can be modified w/ a scripting language such as JavaScript. The DOM tree is a hierarchical representation of an HTML or XML document. It consists of a root node, which is the document itself, and a series of child nodes that represent the elements, attributes, and text content of the document.

What is a XSS attack? How do they work? How can you guard against them?
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is an attack in which an attacker injects malicious executable scripts into the code of a trusted website. Uses the server to attack visitors(users) of the server. They work by injection, where the attacker finds a vulnerable input field or param. The code that they inject contains malicious code designed to exploit in the context of usersâ€™ browsers. This allows the attackers to manipulate or steal sensitive information and compromises the security of the web page and its users. Some common strategies to guard against them are: Input Validation sanitation, Escape Output, Using Strict mode, avoiding using eval(), regular security outputs, etc.  Helpful link: https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting
