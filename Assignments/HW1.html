<!--  Written Hw 1 Qs and As:
1. What happens from the time a user puts a URL into their browser to when they are able
to view a webpage? - Briefly define ISP, URL, DNS, web server.
    -An ISP, or Internet Service Provider, is a company that provides individuals and organizations with access to the internet. 
    When a user enters a URL, or Uniform Resource Locator, into their browser, the browser queries the DNS, or Domain Name System, 
    to translate the human-readable domain name into an IP address that computers can understand. 
    This IP address points to a specific web server, a computer program or hardware device that hosts websites and serves web pages 
    over the internet. The web server receives the browser's request, retrieves the requested web pages and associated files, and sends 
    them back to the browser for display. Throughout this process, the user's device remains connected to the internet through their ISP, 
    enabling access to the World Wide Web.

2. What is html? What does it do?
    - Html is the standard markup language for creating webpages. 
    It defines the content and structure of the web content that will be displayed in the web browser. 
    This markup tells the web browser what and how to display text, images, and other content on a webpage. 

3. Access https://www.fordham.edu/. In your own words, describe how this webpage uses
structure to convey meaning and navigation options to the user.
    -Fordham's webpage does a good job at making everything really accessable to the user. Upon accessing the site, the homepage is well-organized, 
    featuring a clear header with the university's logo and main navigation menu, including links to important sections such as About, Academics, 
    Admissions, and Alumni. Below the header, the page is divided into distinct sections, each with a clear heading and content related to a specific 
    aspect of the university, such as news updates, events, academic programs, and student resources. 
    This hierarchical structure helps users quickly identify and navigate to the information they are interested in. 

4. What is an html element? Tag? Attribute?
    - Tags act like containers as they tell you something about the information that lies between their opening and closing tags. 
    Example: <h1> tag indicates that anything between it and the closing tag </h1> will be the main heading of the webpage.-->
