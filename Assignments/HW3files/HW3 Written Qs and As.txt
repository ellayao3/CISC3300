HW3 Written Qs and As:
Compare and contrast margin, padding, and border
Margin is the space outside the border of an element. It creates space between the element's border and surrounding elements. 
It is commonly used to create spacing between elements on a page.  Margins do not have a background color, and they do not affect
the size or layout of the element itself. Padding is the space between the content of an element and its border. It creates space 
within the element. Padding is often used to add internal space or breathing room around the content within an element. Padding is 
affected by the background color or image of the element, and it does not affect the size of the element itself. Border is the line 
or outline that surrounds the padding and content of an element. Borders are commonly used to visually separate or highlight elements
on a page. Borders can have various styles (solid, dashed, dotted, etc.), colors, and widths, and they directly affect the size of the element.

Define the following flexbox css rules https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/:
a. display: flex
b. Flex-direction
c. Flex-wrap
d. justify-content/align-items
e. align-content


a. This rule is applied to a container element to establish a flex container. It enables a flex context for all its direct children. 
This means the children of this container can be flex items, and they will follow the flex layout rules
b. This property specifies the direction of the main axis in a flex container. It determines how flex items are laid out within the container. 
Possible values are: row: Items are laid out horizontally in the same direction as the writing mode. row-reverse: Items are laid out horizontally
in the opposite direction of the writing mode.  column: Items are laid out vertically from top to bottom. column-reverse: Items are laid out vertically 
from bottom to top.
c. This property specifies whether flex items are forced onto a single line or can wrap onto multiple lines within a flex container when there's not enough 
space along the main axis. Possible values are: nowrap: All flex items are forced onto one line (default behavior). wrap: Flex items can wrap onto multiple 
lines if needed. wrap-reverse: Flex items wrap onto multiple lines in reverse order.
d. This property aligns flex items along the main axis of the flex container. It helps to distribute extra free space left over when either all the flex items 
on a line are inflexible, or are flexible but have reached their maximum size. Possible values are: flex-start: Items are packed toward the start of the main axis.
flex-end: Items are packed toward the end of the main axis. center: Items are centered along the main axis. space-between: Items are evenly distributed along the main
axis with the first item at the start and the last item at the end. space-around: Items are evenly distributed along the main axis with equal space around them.
e. This property aligns flex items along the cross axis of the flex container. It helps to control how flex items are positioned within the flex container in the 
cross-axis direction. Possible values are: stretch: Items are stretched to fill the container. flex-start: Items are packed toward the start of the cross axis. flex-end: Items are
packed toward the end of the cross axis. center: Items are centered along the cross axis. baseline: Items are aligned such as their baselines align. 
f. This property aligns a flex container's lines within the flex container when there is extra space on the cross-axis. It has effect only when flex items are wrapped onto 
multiple lines using flex-wrap. Possible values are: flex-start: Lines are packed toward the start of the cross axis. flex-end: Lines are packed toward the end of the
cross axis. center: Lines are centered along the cross axis. space-between: Lines are evenly distributed along the cross axis with the first line at the start and the last line 
at the end. space-around: Lines are evenly distributed along the cross axis with equal space around them. stretch: Lines are stretched to fit the container.
